<h2 title="April Fools!">Bike Transportation</h2><p>Fixing Felton's Bike Transportation Problem.<br/><br/>Every time I want to bike somewhere in Felton either from my house to the School, Or to my friends houses, I have<br />  to bike along Highway 9. The bike lane I am forced to travel along gives me barely enough room to move <br /> without biking into cars going 40+ miles an hour. In 2016 â€” 18,477 cyclist were injured in road accidents. <br /> A lot of the time accidents like this happen becuase the bicyclist are too close to the motor vehicles <br /> on the roads. If there was a safer way for bikers to bike to and from a destination, then more people would <br /> bike places resulting in a healthier community, and there would be less injuries in general.
